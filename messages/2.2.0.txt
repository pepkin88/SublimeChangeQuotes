Installation instructions for ChangeQuotes, version 2.2.0

TL;DR - try restarting Sublime Text

Thanks to the awesome refactor from Simeon Manolov (@smanolloff), we have
migrated to a settings-file-based code base.  This adds support for JavaScript's
backtick-strings, but the settings file MAY not be loaded automatically!  Try
this: open a new file, put it in javascript (or python or ruby) syntax, type a
string literal, and activate the "change_quotes" command.  If it doesn't work,
just restart Sublime Text and you should be all good.

If you continue to have trouble, open an issue!

Thanks!

Colin T.A. Gray, and another big thanks to Simeon Manolov. :)
